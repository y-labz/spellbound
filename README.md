## So I wrote this mod ...

- for me and my kids to spend time together & have fun 
- for the kids to learn typing & type fast
- for the kids to learn some English words, Math & Coding

I am new to Luanti and Lua, so expect some basic mistakes.
And I do not have a lot of time for this repo...

All the usage should be found in the spellbook.txt.

### About the name...

- "Spells" - my first choice, but might be too big and general...
- "ySpells" - would be OK, could be better...
- "Spellbook" - sounds really cool, but widely used already...
