## So I wrote this mod ...

- for me and my kids to spend time together & have fun 
- motivate the kids to learn typing & type fast
- motivate the kids to learn some English words, Math & Coding

I am new to Luanti and Lua, so expect some basic mistakes.
And I do not have a lot of time for this repo...

All the usage should be found in the spellbook.txt.

### About the name...

- "Spells" - my first choice, but might be too big and general...
- "ySpells" - would be OK, could be better...
- "Spellbook" - sounds really cool, but widely used already...

I removed some cool data set (like the dragon) to avoid any license issues.
Goto sites like free3d.com and get your favorite models, or use your 3D scanner.
Convert them to xyz data with any tool you like and put them into models folder.

Don't forget to share your build screenshot in Luanti Forum.
