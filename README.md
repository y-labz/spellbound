# Spellbound

-------------------------------
A Mod for Minetest Game: a mystical collection of spells / chatcommands to enchant your Minetest experience.
From summoning structures to conjuring chaos, this mod brings command-line wizardry to your fingertips. ðŸª„

-------------------------------
The main purpose of this mod is for me and my kids to have fun.
I am new to Luanti and Lua, so you get the idea...
And I do not have a lot of time for this repo...

-------------------------------
About the name...
"Spells" - my first choice, but might be too big and general...
"ySpells" - would be OK, could be better...
"Spellbook" - sounds really cool, but widely used already...
