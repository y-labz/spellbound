I removed some cool data set (like the dragon) to avoid any license issues.
Goto sites like free3d.com and get your favorite models, or just use your 3D scanner.
Convert them to xyz data with any tool you like and put them into models folder.

Don't forget to share your build screenshot in Luanti Forum.

## So I wrote this mod ...

- for me and my kids to spend time together & have fun 
- to motivate the kids to learn typing & type fast
- to motivate the kids to learn some English words, Math & Coding

I am new to Luanti and Lua, so expect some basic mistakes.
And I do not have a lot of time for this repo...

All the usage should be found in the spellbook-more.txt.
